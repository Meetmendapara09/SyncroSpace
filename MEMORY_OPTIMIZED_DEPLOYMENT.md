# Memory-Optimized Deployment Guide for SyncroSpace

## Build Issue: Code 143

SyncroSpace is experiencing build terminations with error code 143, which indicates the build process is being killed due to memory constraints. This guide provides solutions for development, testing, and production deployment.

## Quick Solutions

### For Local Development:

```bash
# Run the development server (best option for development work)
npm run dev
```

### For Testing Without a Full Build:

```bash
# Use the simple placeholder app with a basic HTTP server
npm run start:simple
```

### For Production Deployment:

Option 1: Use a larger build machine (8GB+ RAM)
```bash
# On a machine with at least 8GB RAM
npm run build
npm start
```

Option 2: Use CI/CD pipeline deployment (recommended)
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds in a high-memory environment
- Deploy to a service like Vercel, Netlify, or a custom server

## Why This Happens

The build process is being terminated with code 143 because:

1. The codebase has grown large with many components and dependencies
2. Next.js needs significant memory to optimize production builds
3. The current environment has limited memory resources
4. The build includes complex optimizations like code splitting and tree shaking

## Long-Term Solutions

1. **Optimize Dependencies**: Reduce bundle size by auditing and removing unnecessary dependencies
2. **Code Splitting**: Further modularize the application for better build performance
3. **Lazy Loading**: Implement more lazy loading for components and routes
4. **Build on a Larger Instance**: Use a more powerful machine for builds
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated builds in an environment with adequate resources

## Note for Production

The `npm run start:simple` option is a temporary solution and should not be used for production. It's only meant for testing basic functionality when a full build isn't possible.

For production, either use a larger build machine or set up a CI/CD pipeline with adequate resources.
