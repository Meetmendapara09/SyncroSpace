## Usage Examples

### Creating a Team
```typescript
const createTeam = async (teamData: TeamInput) => {
  const teamRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'teams'), {
    ...teamData,
    createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
    ownerId: user.uid,
  });

  // Add owner as first member
  await addDoc(collection(db, 'teamMembers'), {
    teamId: teamRef.id,
    userId: user.uid,
    role: 'owner',
    joinedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  });

  return teamRef.id;
};
```

### Managing Tasks
```typescript
const updateTaskStatus = async (taskId: string, newStatus: TaskStatus) => {
  await updateDoc(doc(db, 'teamTasks', taskId), {
    status: newStatus,
    updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  });
};
```

### File Upload
```typescript
const uploadFile = async (file: File, teamId: string) => {
  const storageRef = ref(storage, `teams/${teamId}/files/${file.name}`);
  await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);

  const downloadURL = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);

  await addDoc(collection(db, 'teamFiles'), {
    teamId,
    name: file.name,
    url: downloadURL,
    size: file.size,
    uploadedBy: user.uid,
    uploadedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  });
};
```
