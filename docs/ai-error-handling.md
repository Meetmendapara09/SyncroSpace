# AI Error Handling Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the error handling in AI functions throughout the SyncroSpace application.

## New Utility
Created a standardized error handling utility (`/src/lib/ai-error-handler.ts`) with the following features:
- Consistent error handling across all AI functions
- Built-in retry mechanism for transient errors
- Timeout handling to prevent hanging requests
- Detailed error logging
- Customizable error messages

## Component Updates
Updated all components that use AI functions to leverage the new error handling utility:

### 1. Chatbot Component
- Added timeout handling (15 seconds)
- Implemented retry mechanism
- Improved error messages displayed to users
- Enhanced error reporting in console

### 2. Avatar Generation Dialog
- Added timeout handling (20 seconds)
- Input validation to prevent empty prompts
- Sanitized user inputs
- More specific error messages based on error type

### 3. Meeting Summarization
- Added timeout handling (60 seconds)
- Enhanced validation of audio data
- Improved error messages for common issues (audio quality, format)
- Better handling of failed summarizations

### 4. Contact Form
- Added input validation
- Improved email format checking
- Sanitized inputs
- Added detailed error messaging

## AI Flow Updates
Enhanced error handling in all AI flow files:

### 1. Chatbot Flow (`/src/ai/flows/chatbot.ts`)
- Added input validation
- Improved error handling in the flow definition
- Added output validation to ensure responses are complete
- Better error reporting

### 2. Avatar Generation Flow (`/src/ai/flows/generate-avatar.ts`)
- Added input validation and sanitization
- Improved error handling for safety policy violations
- Enhanced validation of generated images
- Better error classification

### 3. Meeting Summarization Flow (`/src/ai/flows/summarize-meeting.ts`)
- Added validation of audio data format
- Enhanced output validation to ensure complete transcript and summary
- Added quality checks for transcript and summary
- Improved error messages for audio processing issues

### 4. Channel Suggestion Flow (`/src/ai/flows/suggest-channel.ts`)
- Added input validation
- Enhanced output validation to ensure complete and meaningful suggestions
- Better error classification and reporting

### 5. Contact Form Flow (`/src/ai/flows/contact.ts`)
- Added input validation and sanitization
- Enhanced email validation
- Added timestamp logging
- Improved error reporting

## Testing Framework
Enhanced the dev.ts file with comprehensive testing capabilities:
- Created a unified test framework for all AI flows
- Added detailed error reporting
- Added ability to run all tests at once
- Improved error details in test results

## Benefits
These improvements provide the following benefits:
1. More robust error handling across all AI features
2. Better user experience with more specific error messages
3. Automatic retries for transient failures
4. Protection against hanging requests with timeouts
5. Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed error logging
6. Standardized approach to error handling across the application

## Next Steps
Consider implementing the following future improvements:
1. Add telemetry to track AI function performance and error rates
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern for AI services during outages
3. Add graceful degradation for AI features when services are unavailable
4. Create an admin dashboard to monitor AI service health
