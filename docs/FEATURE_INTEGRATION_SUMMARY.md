# SyncroSpace Feature Integration

This document outlines how all the features from CaveVerse have been integrated into the SyncroSpace application, ensuring proper data flow and feature interactions.

## System Architecture

The integration follows an event-driven architecture with a central service that coordinates communication between different features:

1. **Feature Integration Service**: Central service that manages data flow between features
2. **Redux Store**: For state management with specific slices for different features
3. **Firebase Databases**: For persistent storage and real-time updates
4. **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer video and audio communication
5. **Event Bus**: For cross-component communication using pub/sub pattern

## Core Components

### Feature Integration Service

Located in `/src/lib/feature-integration.ts`, this service:

- Initializes user data and manages presence
- Handles room joining/leaving
- Manages message sending/receiving
- Updates user positions in the virtual space
- Tracks zone movements
- Persists and restores sessions

### React Hook for Components

The `useSyncroSpaceFeatures` hook in `/src/lib/hooks/use-syncrospace-features.ts` provides:

- Easy access to feature integration from React components
- Manages initialization of the service
- Exposes methods for components to interact with features
- Handles event subscriptions and cleanup

### Enhanced Chat Component

The enhanced chat component in `/src/components/meeting/enhanced-meeting-chat.tsx`:

- Provides both proximity (nearby) and global (room) chat modes
- Shows notifications for new messages
- Displays avatars and timestamps
- Filters messages based on proximity when in office chat mode

### Character Selection Integration

The character selection wrapper in `/src/components/meeting/character-selection-wrapper.tsx`:

- Integrates with the feature service to update character selection
- Persists character selection in Firebase
- Updates Redux store with selected character

### Integrated Office View

The integrated office view in `/src/components/meeting/integrated-office-view.tsx`:

- Renders the virtual office with canvas
- Handles movement and zone transitions
- Displays connected users with their avatars
- Shows proximity indicators
- Provides controls for webcam/mic/screen sharing

## Database Schema

The Firebase Realtime Database follows this structure:

```
users/
  $userId/
    status: { state, lastSeen }
    profile: { username, avatar, ... }
    settings: { ... }
    presence: { lastActive, isOnline, currentRoom, position }
    notifications: { $notificationId: { type, message, timestamp, isRead, from } }

rooms/
  $roomId/
    members/
      $userId: { userId, username, avatar, joinedAt, position, ... }
    messages/
      global/
        $messageId: { userId, username, message, timestamp, avatar, type }
      proximity/
        $messageId: { userId, username, message, timestamp, avatar, type, position }
    zoneActivity/
      $zoneId/
        activeUsers: { $userId: true }
        settings: { ... }
    userPositions/
      $userId: { x, y, lastUpdated }
    activeCharacters/
      $userId: "characterId"

rtcSignaling/
  $sessionId/
    offers: { ... }
    answers: { ... }
    candidates: { ... }
    participants: { ... }

chatMetrics/
  $roomId/
    messageCount: number
    lastActive: timestamp
    activeUsers: { $userId: { lastMessage: timestamp } }
```

## Security Rules

Firebase Realtime Database security rules are defined in `/database-rules.json` with these key principles:

1. All data requires authentication to access
2. User data can only be modified by the user or an admin
3. Room messages can only be read/written by room members
4. User positions can only be updated by the user themselves
5. Chat metrics are secured with proper validation

## WebRTC Integration

WebRTC is integrated through:

1. Signaling through Firebase Realtime Database
2. Proximity-based audio volume adjustment
3. Video/audio stream management connected to Redux
4. Screen sharing capabilities

## Event Flow Example

1. User selects a character:
   - Component calls `selectCharacter()` from the hook
   - Hook emits event on the event bus
   - Feature integration service updates Firebase
   - Redux store is updated

2. User sends a message:
   - Component calls `sendMessage()` from the hook
   - Feature service adds message to Firebase
   - Firebase triggers update listeners
   - Message appears in other users' chat components

3. User moves in the office:
   - Canvas registers click and calls `updatePosition()`
   - Position is updated in Firebase
   - Proximity calculations determine nearby users
   - Chat filters messages based on proximity

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Firebase Configuration**: Ensure proper Firebase configuration is set up
2. **WebRTC Servers**: STUN/TURN servers for WebRTC connections
3. **Performance Optimization**: Limit real-time updates frequency
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for network failures

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Support**: Implement offline mode with synchronization
2. **Advanced Proximity**: Add sound visualization for proximity audio
3. **Custom Zones**: Allow admin users to create custom zones
4. **Analytics**: Add more detailed metrics for room usage
5. **Mobile Support**: Optimize UI for mobile devices

## Testing

Test these integrations by:

1. Opening multiple browser sessions
2. Verifying real-time updates across sessions
3. Testing proximity chat with users in different positions
4. Verifying WebRTC connections between users
5. Testing session persistence and restoration
