# SyncroSpace Error Documentation

This document lists all significant errors found in the SyncroSpace codebase along with their locations and possible solutions.

## Fixed Errors

The following errors have been resolved:

1. **Channel Interface Inconsistency**: Added missing `categoryId` property to Channel interface in channel-settings.tsx
2. **WebRTC Interface Compatibility**: Updated RoomHandles interface to handle null MediaStream and added roomId property
3. **Missing StopScreenShare Component**: Created a custom StopScreenShare component in src/components/icons/
4. **Position Validation in Virtual Space**: Added proper Position interface and collision detection module
5. **Meeting Summarization API**: Updated API to accept both transcript and audioDataUri inputs

## TypeScript Compilation Errors

### 1. Firebase Import Errors

- **Location**: Various components that import Firebase services
- **Description**: Incorrect imports where `firestore` was used instead of the correct `db` import
- **Example**: `import { firestore } from '@/lib/firebase'` should be `import { db } from '@/lib/firebase'`
- **Solution**: Ensure consistent import naming for Firebase services across the codebase

### 2. Missing Interface Properties

- **Location**: Channel interface implementations
- **Description**: Missing `categoryId` property in Channel interfaces caused type mismatch errors
- **Solution**: Add missing properties to interfaces to ensure type compatibility

### 3. Ref Assignment Issues

- **Location**: `video-audio-call` component
- **Description**: Improper handling of readonly ref assignments
- **Solution**: Use proper ref handling patterns in React components

### 4. WebRTC Interface Compatibility

- **Location**: `virtual-space` component
- **Description**: Incorrect property access in RoomHandles interface
- **Solution**: Update properties to match the WebRTC API implementation

### 5. Missing Components

- **Location**: Imports in various files
- **Description**: Importing non-existent components like `StopScreenShare` from `lucide-react`
- **Solution**: Use existing alternatives such as `ScreenShare` with appropriate state management

## Next.js Build Errors

### 1. Type Error in Generated Files

- **Location**: `.next/types/app/(app)/users/[userId]/page.ts`
- **Description**: Type error in Next.js generated type file
- **Impact**: This error is in a generated file and doesn't affect application functionality
- **Note**: This is mentioned in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as a known issue

### 2. Dynamic Route Handling

- **Location**: Dynamic route pages
- **Description**: Missing or incorrect implementation of `generateStaticParams()` for static exports
- **Solution**: Implement proper `generateStaticParams()` for all dynamic routes

## Runtime Errors

### 1. Genkit Schema Validation Error

- **Location**: AI integration components
- **Description**: Validation error in AI schema when attempting to use Genkit
- **Solution**: Proper error handling implemented via `withAIErrorHandling` and `createAIFallback` utilities

### 2. Firebase Permissions Error

- **Location**: Data access operations
- **Description**: Security rules preventing access to certain resources
- **Solution**: Update Firebase security rules to support all required features

### 3. BigQuery API Endpoint Error

- **Location**: BigQuery integration
- **Description**: Connection failures to BigQuery API endpoints
- **Solution**: Provide fallback mechanisms and proper error handling

### 4. Network Connectivity Issues

- **Location**: Real-time functionality (WebRTC, Firebase)
- **Description**: Intermittent network connectivity problems affecting real-time features
- **Solution**: Implement proper connection state management and reconnection logic

## UI/UX Errors

### 1. CSS Intellisense Issues

- **Location**: Tailwind CSS `@apply` and `@tailwind` rules
- **Description**: Rules showing as "unknown" in the editor
- **Impact**: This is a VS Code intellisense issue that doesn't affect build or functionality
- **Note**: Mentioned in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as a known issue

### 2. Responsive Design Breakpoints

- **Location**: Various UI components
- **Description**: Layout issues at specific viewport breakpoints
- **Solution**: Use consistent breakpoint definitions and test thoroughly

## Memory and Performance Issues

### 1. Memory Constraints During Build

- **Location**: Build process
- **Description**: Full application build requires more memory than available in some environments
- **Solution**: Created memory-optimized build process and documented in `MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Alternative Solutions**: 
  - Run the development server: `npm run dev`
  - Use a build environment with at least 8GB of RAM

### 2. Resource-Intensive Operations

- **Location**: Real-time collaboration features
- **Description**: High memory/CPU usage during concurrent operations
- **Solution**: Optimize resource usage and implement throttling where appropriate

## Known Issues with Workarounds

### 1. BigQuery AI Integration

- **Location**: AI-powered analytics features
- **Description**: Integration issues with BigQuery
- **Workaround**: The system currently uses mock data for AI functions while maintaining the same interface
- **Documentation**: Complete troubleshooting information available in `docs/troubleshooting-guide.md`

### 2. Avatar Movement in Virtual Spaces

- **Location**: `virtual-space.tsx`
- **Description**: Occasional collision detection issues with map boundaries
- **Solution**: Enhanced collision detection logic implemented in `isPositionValid` function

## Next Steps for Issue Resolution

As documented in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, the following steps are recommended for addressing remaining issues:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all Firebase config variables are properly set in production
2. **Firebase Security**: Review and test Firestore security rules in production environment
3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing code splitting for large components
4. **Error Boundary**: Add error boundaries for better error handling
5. **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for critical features
6. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and performance monitoring
